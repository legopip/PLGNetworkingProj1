NOTE:
Build order doesn't save over git downloads. makes sure to run the server, then run the client.

NOTE: 
sometimes window OS sounds play when sending a message. Nothing crashes, it just makes the noise.

Genuanly don't know what is causing that, so if you know what it might be, feedback would be appreciated.
