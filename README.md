~~ PLG Networking Project 1: Socket Chatroom ~~

A chatroom concole app using winsock

Tested in Debug x64

Video Demo link (youtube): https://youtu.be/NJl9cbE1zgA


NOTE:
Build order doesn't save over git downloads. makes sure to run the server, then run the client.

-or-

Go to properties of solution, set the build order to;

-lib
-server
-client (PLGNetworkingProj1)

Then:

add "$(SolutionDir)PLGNetworkingProj1Lib;" to VC++ Directories under proporties for both the server and the client project

Terribly sorry for the inconvinience, but these properties didn't carry with git. Feedback of how to fix this would help with projects going forword

NOTE: 
sometimes window OS sounds play when sending a message. Nothing crashes, it just makes the noise.

Genuinely don't know what is causing that, so if you know what it might be, feedback would be appreciated.
